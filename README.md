# Shadowverse-Sandbag-Script
This is a shadowverse sandbagging script that automates joining a game and instantly leaving.

Step 1: Open up Shadowverse and navigate to the Select Deck Page (MULTI > Play ranked matches > Rotation/Unlimited)

Step 2: Run the Java Program

Step 3: Enter the number of games you would like to drop.

(Note: I've only tested this script on a 1920x1080 monitor. So there's a chance that this may not work properly on different resolutions or screen sizes)

Update: DOES NOT WORK ON ANY MONITOR SIZE BESIDES 23 inch FULL SCREEN 1920x1080 (tested with my new 27 inch monitor and cursor no longer accurately moves)
